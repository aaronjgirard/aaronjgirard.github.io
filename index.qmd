## About Me

I am a researcher at the [Center for Wave Phenomena](https://cwp.mines.edu/) in the Geophysics Department at [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/). My work spans seismic data processing and imaging, ambient/passive seismic monitoring, and high-performance computing applications in geophysics.

I am actively involved in developing open-source tools for the geophysics community, including contributions to the [DASCORE](https://dascore.org/) distributed fiber optic sensing library and [Madagascar](https://www.reproducibility.org/) software for reproducible computational experiments.
