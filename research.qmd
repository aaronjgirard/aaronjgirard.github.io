## Current Projects

### Ultra-Low-Frequency Ambient Ocean-Bottom Seismology

Investigating the potential of ultra-low-frequency signals recorded on ocean-bottom nodes for subsurface imaging and characterization. This work explores new frequency bands that have traditionally been underutilized in exploration seismology.

### Kīlauea Summit Velocity Modeling

Active-source tomography velocity modelling of the Kīlauea summit and surrounding area, contributing to our understanding of volcanic systems.

### CO₂ Sequestration Monitoring

Time-lapse seismic monitoring using full waveform inversion for carbon capture and storage sites, helping to ensure safe and effective CO₂ sequestration.
